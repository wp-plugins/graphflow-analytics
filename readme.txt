= How does it work? =

Graphflow collects details on the customer events that occur in your store - including product page views, adding products to the cart, and purchases. Using your store's event data, Graphflow's state of the art recommendation engine generates personalized recommendations for your customers, as well as "similar products" for each of your products.

You can use any combination of the following:

1. Show similar product recommendations on your product pages
2. Show personalized user recommendations on your main Shop page and your Product Category pages
3. Show recommendations on your cart page before a customer checks out, based on the products in their cart and their individual activity history
4. Show recommendations anywhere on your site using our recommendations widget or shortcode. For example, you could show user recommendations on the Account page.
5. Insert recommendations and coupons into your WooCommerce order emails, as well as scheduled Follow Up emails.
